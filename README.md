# hello-world2

I’m ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI, and I’m here to assist you with a wide variety of tasks! Whether you need help answering questions, writing emails, brainstorming ideas, learning new topics, or just having a chat, I’m ready to assist. My training spans a broad range of subjects, so I can provide information on tech, science, creative writing, personal advice, and much more.

I don’t have personal experiences or a physical form, but I strive to offer helpful, thoughtful, and accurate responses based on the information I've been trained on. My goal is to make your tasks easier and more enjoyable!

This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
